### 1-Description
This is my first project using React.js. It's a simple concentration game where you have to click each picture once, but only once, to win. The app records the high score from the current session, but does not make use of persistent storage.


### 2-Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

### 3-Challenges
The purpose of this project was to learn to put together a basic React application that made use of state and both "smart" and "dumb" components. The biggest challenge was in wrapping my head around how data flows through the various components and state. Data is passed from one component to another via properties ("props"); functions can be also be passed as a prop and then called from within nested components to change state in a parent component.
